# EcoHealth
This simple app was created as my final project for the Kode with Klossy 2022 Summer Program. I completed app development for the 2 weeks of camp. I collaborated with 3 other girls to develop the app. 
The goal of the app is to provide users with ways to sunstainably stay fit by eating healthy foods, using eco-friendly gyms, and providing them with daily facts about healthy lifestyles. 
The main code involved was using the IBAction outlets to connect our buttons to webpages. We also implemented an array to generate random facts for the "Daily Facts" section.
